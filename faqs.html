            <h3>How much power does a REVOLT wind turbine make?</h3>
            <div>
              <p>Currently, a 16" diameter REVOLT wind turbine will make 2.2 watts in a 15-mph wind.
                That's enough power to charge four smartphones at once! However, we're working on the
                design of a new alternator that will produce even more power. The 5' diameter REVOLT
                wind turbine will make the same amount of power as a traditional tower-mounted windmill.
              </p>
            </div>
            <h3>How do I install it?</h3>
            <div>
              <p>Just hang it from a tree branch, hook, or line and wait for the wind to blow.</p>
            </div>
            <h3>How fast can I set it up and begin producing power?</h3>
            <div>
              <p>It should only take a few minutes to assemble the windmill. Then all you need to do is
                find a place to hang it. If the wind is blowing, it will begin producing power
                immediately.</p>
            </div>
            <h3>What tools do I need?</h3>
            <div>
              <p>No tools are required to assemble or hang the small REVOLT. The large REVOLT will require
                a wrench or pliers for the bolts on the blades.</p>
            </div>
            <h3>How much wind do I need?</h3>
            <div>
              <p>The small REVOLT windmills start spinning in a 4-mph wind. LED lights work in a 6-mph
                wind. Four smartphones will charge in a 15-mph wind, Each time the wind speed is
                doubled, the windmill will theoretically produce eight times more power. The large
                REVOLT starts spinning in a 7-8 mph winds.</p>
            </div>
            <h3>Where can I use it?</h3>
            <div>
              <p>You can use the REVOLT anywhere the wind blows!</p>
            </div>
            <h3>Does it work in gusty or low-wind conditions?</h3>
            <div>
              <p>Yes. A small REVOLT starts spinning in a 4-mph wind and starts producing usable power in
                a 6-mph wind. The large REVOLT starts spinning in a 7-8 mph. All REVOLT wind turbines
                will work in both stormy and gusty wind conditions.</p>
            </div>
            <h3>Where do I hang it?</h3>
            <div>
              <p>You can hang your REVOLT just about anywhere. Try to find a windy spot and safely hang it
                as high as possible. Hang it a reasonable distance away from objects, people or
                structures so that the blades don't hit anything.</p>
            </div>
            <h3>What if it breaks?</h3>
            <div>
              <p>Although the REVOLT is both rugged and durable, accidents happen and moving parts wear
                out. Replacement parts are available and it's easy, inexpensive, and convenient to
                repair.</p>
            </div>
            <h3>How can I charge my cell phone using a Mini REVOLT windmill?</h3>
            <div>
              <p>Just plug your device into the USB port.</p>
            </div>
            <h3>How long will it take to charge my device using a Mini REVOLT windmill?</h3>
            <div>
              <p>That's a difficult question to answer because there are so many devices with so many
                variables. If you have steady 10-mph winds, a smartphone should charge in about the same
                time as any other charger.</p>
            </div>
            <h3>Do I need special knowledge or training to operate a small REVOLT windmill?</h3>
            <div>
              <p>No. All you need to do is safely hang the windmill and wait for the wind to blow. Then,
                just plug your device into the USB port.</p>
            </div>
            <h3>How does it compare to solar power systems?</h3>
            <div>
              <p>Please see the <a href="articles.html">articles page</a> to compare the costs and key
                features of different green energy systems.</p>
            </div>
            <h3>What can I do with it?</h3>
            <div>
              <p>REVOLT windmills can be modified or configured to charge or power any electronic device.
                <a href="contact.html">Send us your question</a> if you require
                assistance.</p>
            </div>
            <h3>Will it hurt birds and bats?</h3>
            <div>
              <p>We don't think so! Please see our article <a href="articles.html"><q>Windmills v Birds
                    and Bats</q></a> to find out why.</p>
            </div>
            <h3>How will I know when the Mini REVOLT becomes available?</h3>
            <div>
              <p>Keep checking back or get notified when REVOLT wind turbines become available. <a href="contact.html">Just send us your email address.</a> We
                will not sell or use your email address for any other reason.</p>
            </div>
            <h3>Does it come in different sizes?</h3>
            <div>
              <p>It will! The first REVOLT will be a 5' diameter windmill. In the future there will be
                larger and smaller sizes to accommodate different needs.</p>
            </div>
            <h3>Is it safe?</h3>
            <div>
              <p>Yes! The 16 inch diameter wind turbine will not cause injury under normal circumstances.
                Just make sure it won't hit anyone in the eye... for obvious reasons. Use common sense
                when choosing a location to hang your REVOLT. Make sure that the windmill will not hit
                any other object when it is in use.</p>
              <p>If you are concerned with the safety of the wildlife in your area, studies suggest that
                most birds are not killed by the blades of spinning windmills. The most probable cause
                of fatalities is barotrauma (internal hemorrhaging caused by air pressure differences).
                As wind moves through large wind turbines, the air pressure drops by 5-10 kilopascals.
                Small wind turbines do not create these large pressure drops. There are no studies that
                we are aware of that suggest small wind turbines cause injuries to birds, nor have we
                observed any injures. In fact, birds seem to enjoy perching on the cable from where our
                REVOLT hangs.</p>
            </div>
            <h3>Does it require maintenance?</h3>
            <div>
              <p>The REVOLT does not require regular maintenance. But, windmills have moving parts and
                things with moving parts wear out over time. The magnets in the alternator can wear out
                from overheating, bearings can corrode over time due to excessive salt, moisture, or
                dust, plastic parts can become brittle and break from long-term UV exposure, and
                batteries have limited lifetimes. The good news is that all of the parts of the REVOLT
                can be replaced safely and inexpensively. All replacement parts will be available for
                order from our website once we begin production.</p>
