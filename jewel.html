						<!-- SUMMARY CONTENT -->
						<div id="summaryContent"></div>
						<p>
							One unit of currency named a “Joule” will be mined for each watt
							of green energy generating capacity installed and made operational
							anywhere in the world. When the green energy device is installed
							and begins making power, the Joule is certified. The buyer of the
							system gets the green energy generator as ordered. The
							manufacturer and buyer share the Joules per agreement at the time
							of sale.
						</p>
						<p>
							Electric power does work that reduces the need for labor. Unlike
							precious metals that are difficult to carry or a digital currency
							that requires a computer and therefore power to be useful, a watt
							is a known physical constant that can be substituted for labor to
							create wealth. Concrete is made of dirt heated to 1800 degrees
							reinforced with steel made of coke and iron ore heated to 4500
							degrees. With only a few laborers we are able to build skyscrapers
							and millions of miles of highways with bridges to carry us at mile
							a minute speed in air conditioned luxury. We have enough Joules
							stored in coal, oil and natural gas to replace hundreds of
							millions of laborers.
						</p>
						<p>
							The currency of a country is backed by that countries ability to
							create wealth. Either with labor, or power combined with labor.
							The Joule is a fundamental standard of currency based on the power
							of the watt to replace manual labor. All global assets should be
							valued in Joules. From the sovereign currencies of nations to
							commodities, real estate, stocks, bonds and digital assets. There
							is presently no economic standard of exchange. The Joule will be
							the first.
						</p>
						<p>
							As Joules are mined, they will go up in value. Anyone wishing to
							mine Joules can purchase green energy generating systems and use
							them or give them to someone that needs power. As Joules are
							mined, the new green energy capacity brings power to those that
							need it but cannot afford it. While at the same time those who
							already have power can increase their wealth by mining Joules and
							giving the systems away to those who need power and have the labor
							needed to get them running. As the systems are put into use around
							the globe they create wealth without harming the environment.
						</p>
						<p>
							Block-chain technology will be used to insure that the device
							making power is the green energy device built to mine the Joules.
							Each generator will have a unique serial number stamped on it and
							a digital address associated with it. If it is too remote to
							communicate with the network it’s existence will be verified
							manually to certify that the Joules mined in building it were not
							counterfeit.
						</p>
						<p>
							The Joule is not a cryptocurrency. It is a real currency backed by
							a physical device that creates power without fuel or exhaust. Once
							the Joule is created it may be printed on paper and carried in a
							wallet and used anywhere in the world, or used as a digital
							currency online.
						</p>
						<p>
							10<sup>18</sup> watts are presently used world wide. That number
							must grow to over 10<sup>20</sup> watts for all to have power. The
							future wealth of a nation will be measured by how many watts per
							citizen it can create. The Joule provides a means to channel
							investor greed into building power for the poor. It will drive
							development of affordable systems as investors seek to maximize
							the number of Joules mined per dollar invested in mining. The
							greatest returns will go to early investors.
