<h2>How Wind Power Works</h2>
<cite>by Sandra Van Berkel</cite>
<p><img src="/images/oldwindmills.jpg" alt="wind technology has been around for a while">Implementing a small wind turbine system for your own needs is one way to guarantee that the energy you use is clean
  and
  renewable. But most people don’t understand how wind power works. The wind, the transformation of kinetic energy to electrical energy, blade design, and turbine placement are all important components of capturing wind power
  efficiently.

<p>The uneven heating of the atmosphere by the sun, irregularities of the earth’s surface, and the rotation of the earth form wind. When the sun heats up an area of land, hot air begins to rise and cooler air flows quickly to fill the
  gap
  the hot air left behind. The cooler air rushing in to fill the gap is wind. Wind can be modified by bodies of water, vegetation, and differences in terrain and vary greatly across the U.S.</p>
<p><img src="/images/windmap.jpg" alt="US Annual Average Wind Speed" style="float: right;" class="windmap"> Wind energy production is the process of capturing the kinetic energy from the wind and transforming it to mechanical or
  electrical power. Wind turbines transfer energy from one medium to another. Air is a gas that contains particles. Moving particles in the wind have kinetic energy. The particles push the turbine blades and cause them to move.</p>
<p>The kinetic energy in wind increases exponentially in proportion to its speed. A small increase in wind speed equates to a large increase in power production potential. In theory, doubling wind speed will produce an eight-fold
  increase
  in power production. This is theoretical because the Betz limit states that only 59% of wind energy can be captured. However, a small increase in wind speed still produces a significant increase in power output.</p>
<p><img src="/images/rotor_stator.png" alt="diagram of rotor and stator" class="noshadow">Turbine blades spin a shaft that leads from the hub of a rotor to an alternator. The alternator converts the rotational energy into electricity using
  electromagnetic
  induction. A very simple alternator consists of a magnet and conductor. The rotor consists of permanent magnets affixed to a shaft and surrounded by coiled wires (the stator). If you have spinning magnets surrounded by coils, one part
  is rotating relative to the other and the system will induce voltage. The voltage drives electrical current out through wires for distribution.</p>
<p>Turbine blades are designed to be twisted so they can always present an angle that takes advantage of an ideal lift-to-drag force ratio. A high lift-to-drag ratio is important when designing an efficient turbine blade because a good
  ratio is what keeps the blades moving with the least resistance.</p>
<p>Blade size is also an important consideration when designing an efficient windmill. The longer the blades, the more energy a turbine can capture from the wind. More energy equates to more electricity-generating capacity. In general,
  if
  you double the blade length you will produce four times the energy output. However, in low-wind conditions, a smaller blade size can potentially produce more energy because it will take less wind-power to spin a smaller windmill.</p>
<p>Height is an important component in wind turbine placement. The higher the turbine, the more energy it can capture. Higher elevations also reduce ground friction, which can interrupt the flow of wind created by nearby stationary
  objects.</p>
<p>REVOLT wind has considered and optimized all of the wind turbine components making it efficient as well as inexpensive. Owning an efficient and inexpensive windmill, like the REVOLT, will generate clean and renewable electrical
  energy
  while making it affordable for nearly everyone on the planet.</p>
