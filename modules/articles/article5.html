<h2>Wind Vision: A New Era for Wind Power in the United States</h2>
<p><img src="/images/windvision.jpg" alt="Wind Vision Logo">The Wind Vision Report, published by the <a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/wind/maps/wind-vision" target="_blank">Office of Energy Efficiency &amp; Renewable Energy</a>, considers
  America’s currently installed
  wind
  power capacity across all forms of wind energy (land-based, offshore, and distributed) as its baseline. This capacity that has tripled since the 2008 release of the Energy Department’s 20% Wind Energy by 2030 report. The report
  assesses
  the potential economic, environmental, and social benefits of a scenario where U.S. wind power supplies 10% of the nation’s electrical demand in 2020, 20% in 2030, and 35% in 2050. The Wind Vision Report builds upon the continued
  success of the wind industry to date and quantifies a robust wind energy future.</p>
<p>Key Findings of the Wind Vision Report:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Wind energy is available nationwide. The Wind Vision Report shows that wind can be a viable source of renewable electricity in all 50 states by 2050.</li>
  <li>Wind energy supports a strong domestic supply chain. Wind has the potential to support over 600,000 jobs in manufacturing, installation, maintenance, and supporting services by 2050.</li>
  <li>Wind energy is affordable. As wind generation agreements typically provide 20-year fixed pricing, the electric utility sector is anticipated to be less sensitive to volatility in natural gas and coal fuel prices with more wind. By
    reducing national vulnerability to price spikes and supply disruptions with long-term pricing, wind is anticipated to save consumers $280 billion by 2050.</li>
  <li>Wind energy reduces air pollution emissions. Operating wind energy capacity avoided the emission of over 250,000 metric tons of air pollutants, which include sulfur dioxide, nitric oxide, nitrogen dioxide, and particulate matter,
    in
    2013. By 2050, wind energy could avoid the emission of 12.3 gigatons of greenhouse gases.</li>
  <li>Wind energy preserves water resources. By 2050, wind energy can save 260 billion gallons of water—the equivalent to roughly 400,000 Olympic-size swimming pools—that would have been used by the electric power sector.</li>
  <li>Wind energy deployment increases community revenues. Local communities will be able to collect additional tax revenue from land lease payments and property taxes, reaching $3.2 billion annually by 2050.</li>
