<h2>Windmills vs birds and bats</h2>

<p><img src="/images/bird.jpg" alt="cute bird picture">Climate change-induced extinctions are likely to threaten one in six species if steps aren’t taken to reduce carbon emissions. <a
    href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/climate-change-threatens-one-in-six-species-with-extinction-study-finds" target="_blank">[1]</a> Since alternative energy reduces carbon emissions, wind turbines will ultimately save birds.</p>
<p>In 2015, Prof Mark Urban from the University of Connecticut reviewed the results of 131 studies on extinction risk to give a global picture of the risks posed by climate change.</p>
<p>The study predicts that as many as 16% of all plant and animal species would be under threat of extinction with four degrees of global warming. <a href="http://hydrodictyon.eeb.uconn.edu/people/urban/files/Urban%202015%20Science.pdf"
    target="_blank">[2]</a> With only two degrees of global warming, a report presented by the WWF Global predicts that bird extinction rates could be as high as 38% in Europe and 72% in NE Australia. <a
    href="http://www.greenenergyfutures.ca/episode/wind-wildlife-impacts" target="_blank">[3]</a> According to a study published September 2, 2015 in the open-access journal PLOS ONE by Gary Langham and colleagues from the National
  Audubon Society, over 50% of nearly 600 surveyed bird species may lose more than half of their current geographic range across three climate change scenarios through the end of the century in North America. <a

<p>Heavy U.S. dependence on foreign oil and increased environmental damage from coal and gas-derived power have stimulated the development of alternative sources of energy production. Because wind power costs less than coal and nuclear
  power and contributes almost no pollutants to the environment, wind turbines are a viable alternative power source and part of a solution to our global warming problem.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, some people are fighting against massive wind turbines because of reported bird mortality rates at large wind farms. However, research shows that large wind turbines kill relatively few birds compared to other
  anthropogenic sources and man-made structures. <a href="https://science.howstuffworks.com/environmental/green-science/wind-turbine-kill-birds.htm" target="_blank">[5]</a></p>
<p><img src="/images/bird_deaths.jpg" alt="Proximate causes of bird fatalities">Although bird fatalities have been reported at all large wind energy facilities, newer wind turbine technology has reduced rates of collisions compared to
  older turbine technology. Because of this, there are a growing number of endorsements by conservation groups. For instance, the American Bird Conservancy supports wind power with newer, bird-friendly designs.<a
    href="https://abcbirds.org/conservationissues/threats/energyproduction/wind.html" target="_blank"> [6]</a> The Wisconsin Bird Initiative concedes that wind turbines are low-impact on bird populations compared to window glass and
  communication towers.<a href="http://www.wisconsinbirds.org/windpower.htm" target="_blank"> [7]</a> And the Audubon Society’s president is quoted by Renewable Energy World as stating, “When you look at a wind turbine, you can find the
  bird carcasses and count them. With a coal-fired power plant, you can't count the carcasses, but it's going to kill a lot more birds."<a href="https://www.renewableenergyworld.com/index/top-news.html" target="_blank"> [8]</a></p>
<p>Although the AWWI reported this year that the current estimates of wind-farm fatalities do not appear likely to lead to population declines in most bird species <a href="https://awwi.org/resources/summary-of-wind-wildlife-interactions-2"
    target="_blank"> [9]</a>, the majority of wind-farm related fatalities are migrating bats. ABC News reports that 600,000 bats per year are killed by large
  wind
  farms. <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wind-turbines-kill-thousands-bats-day/story?id=20997657" target="_blank"> [10]</a></p>
<p>The most probable causes of bat fatalities include direct collisions and barotrauma (internal hemorrhaging caused by air pressure differences).<a href="https://academic.oup.com/jmammal/article/90/6/1330/898623" target="_blank">
    [11]</a> Current research suggests that bats are less likely than birds to directly impact spinning blades, but are more likely to suffer barotrauma because their lungs are less rigid and strong than that of birds. <a
    href="http://www.greenenergyfutures.ca/episode/wind-wildlife-impacts" target="_blank">[3]</a> As wind moves through large wind turbines, the air pressure drops by 5-10 kilopascals. A wind-farm fatality study conducted in 2007 showed
  that 90 percent of the 75 bats dissected had been killed by burst blood vessels in their lungs. The injuries suggest that barotrauma had killed the bats.<a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/wind-turbines-kill-bats/"
    target="_blank">[12]</a></p>
<p>Since little is known about the status of bat populations or the ecological impact of bat fatality levels, conservationists can only suggest that windmill farms should be located away from the migratory flight paths of bats. <a
    href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/wind-turbines-kill-bats/" target="_blank">[12] </a> Because large air pressure drops do not occur with small or micro wind turbines, no study has been found to quantify any possible
  injuries or fatalities to mammals at or around a small or micro wind turbine sites and therefore there have been no recommendations found as to their use or placement.</p>
<p>Note: The largest cause of bat fatalities are humans who are not cognizant of the dangers of accidentally waking bats from their torpor (sleep) and the fatal effect of White Nose Syndrome (WNS). Sleep disruption from humans and WNS
  causes huge metabolic disturbances and leads to starvation during the winter months. Since 2006, 5.7-6.7 million bats have succumbed WNS. For more information, please visit <a href="https://www.whitenosesyndrome.org/"
