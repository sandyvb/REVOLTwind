<h2>Comparing costs of Renewable and Conventional Energy</h2>
<cite>Excerpt by Mitch Tobin</cite>
<p><img src="/images/cost_of_energy.jpg" alt="cost of energy">In essence, this analysis offers an apples-to-apples comparison of the costs of financing, building, operating, and maintaining a power plant. The values are expressed in
  dollars per megawatt-hour.</p>
<p>One of the most widely used levelized cost studies is conducted by Lazard, an international financial advisory and asset management firm. Their latest version of the study, version 8, was released in late 2014. The graphic below
  summarizes the cost components of 16 different energy technologies evaluated by Lazard: 10 of them are alternative (which includes mainly low-carbon, renewable technologies), and six are conventional (which includes fossil fuel
  sources
  and nuclear).</p>
<p>Onshore wind has the lowest average levelized cost in this analysis at $59 per megawatt-hour, and utility-scale photovoltaic plants weren’t far behind at $79. By comparison, the lowest cost conventional technologies were gas combined
  cycle technologies, averaging $74 per megawatt-hour, and coal plants, averaging $109. These numbers are the average of Lazard’s low- and high-end estimates (see their study for more about their cost calculations).</p>
<p>Looking across the 16 technology types, the 10 alternative technologies cost an average $147 per megawatt-hour, $18 less than the conventional approaches. “Certain Alternative Energy generation technologies,” Lazard wrote, “are
  cost-competitive with conventional generational technologies under some scenarios.”</p>
<p>By dividing the costs among capital, fuel, and operations and maintenance (O&amp;M), you can see some dramatic differences among the technologies. Many renewable technologies, such as wind, solar, and geothermal, may not be cheap to
  build, but they have no fuel costs once they’re up and running, and generally have lower O&amp;M costs as well.</p>
