<h2>U.S. Federal and State Renewable Energy Incentives</h2>
<p><img src="/images/dollar.png" alt="dollar bill" class="noshadow">Currently, a federal-level investment tax credit (ITC) is available to help consumers purchase small wind turbines for their home, farm, or business (existing buildings and new
  construction qualify). Owners of small wind systems with 100 kilowatts (kW) of capacity or less can receive a credit for 30% of the total installed cost of the system.</p>
<p>Status:<br />The ITC, written into law through the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, is available for equipment installed from October 3, 2008 through December 31, 2016. The value of the credit is now uncapped, through
  the
  American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.</p>
<p>Rapid Depreciation:<br />Double-declining balance, five-year depreciation schedule (I.R.C. Subtitle A, Ch. 1, Subch. B,Part VI, Sec. 168 (1994) (accelerated cost recovery system)) is another federal policy that encourages wind
  development by allowing the cost of wind equipment to be depreciated faster.</p>
