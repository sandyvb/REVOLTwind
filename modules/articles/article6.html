<h2>Comparing Key Features of Renewable Energy Sources</h2>
<h3 style="padding-top: 20px">The Revolt Hanging Wind Turbine</h3>
<p><img src="/images/revolt_keyfeatures.jpg" alt="REVOLT windmills">In addition to the advantages listed on the <a href="products.html">product page</a>, there are other benefits to owning a REVOLT wind turbine. After preliminary
  testing,
  we estimate that a 1-meter diameter turbine will produce 5 W in a 10 mph wind and 125 W in a 20 mph wind. That means that you could produce over 100 W of power using an inexpensive device that weighs less than 25 pounds. Mass-production
  will make this turbine so inexpensive that the ‘payback time’ (the time it takes to generate enough electricity to make up for the purchase/installation price) will be comparatively brief.</p>
<p>Depending upon the size and your wind conditions, the REVOLT wind turbine may turn out to be the lowest cost green energy generator ever produced!</p>

<h3>Traditional Windmill Designs</h3>
<p><img src="/images/traditional_windmills.jpg" alt="traditional windmill designs">Small, tower-mounted wind turbine setups can cost anywhere from several hundred dollars to several hundred-thousand dollars and require land,
  transmission
  lines, footers, guide wires, and permits. A large-scale commercial setup costs a lot more! A single, 1.8-MW turbine can run up to $1.5 million installed.</p>
<p>Repairs and maintenance are also expensive and dangerous. Tower-mounted windmills are often damaged by lightening and frequently use inefficient gears that require lubrication. They also require expensive control systems that turn
  the
  blades away from heavy wind or reduce the spin rate to avoid damage.</p>

<h3>Vertical-Axis Wind Turbines</h3>
<p><img src="/images/vertical-axis.jpg" alt="vertical axis wind turbines" class="fix-img">Vertical-axis wind turbines represent a significant change in windmill design but are less efficient than traditional turbines and are subject to
  the same disadvantages. They require high-winds to produce power and are damaged by heavy snow and ice loads.</p>

<h3>Solar Panels</h3>
<p><img src="/images/solar-panels.jpg" alt="solar panels" class="fix-img">Solar panels usually need installation permits because they require engineered structural supports that are expensive and immobile. The panels are damaged or lose
  efficiency when subject to high winds, hail, dust, snow loads, or other debris. They require frequent cleaning to maintain their efficiency and repairs can be expensive and dangerous.</p>
