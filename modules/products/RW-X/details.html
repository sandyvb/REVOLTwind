  <h5>Product Description for the RW-X Experimental</h5>
  <img src="/images/buy/hwt.gif" alt="HWT spinning gif">
  <p>The RW-X model Hanging Wind Turbine is capable of producing over 1000 watts, but it is an experimental version at
    this time.</p>
  <p>The diameter of the spinning blades is 5 feet and the windmill weighs about 25 pounds. 100 feet of hanging cable is
    included with the windmill. Also included are the bridge rectifier and digital panel meter showing volts, amps,
    watts, and
    kilowatts.</p>
  <p>The RW-X will charge batteries up to 24 volts. The power output of the windmill in watts is equal to the voltage
    times the current. If you are charging a 24-volt system and the current is 10 amps, the power will be 240 watts (24
    volts x 10
    amps). To
    charge a 12-volt system with 240 watts will require 20 amps of current. This amount of current requires a larger
    wire size. And the size of the wire selected is an important design consideration. For this reason, we are not
    including the power
    cord. If you plan to purchase the RW-X, you will need to perform tests to determine the appropriate wire size to use
    for your application.</p>
  <p><strong>Only individuals with knowledge of how electricity works should purchase the RW-X.</strong></p>
  <p><i>There are 4 units available for purchase at this time.</i></p>

  <!-- <p>The RW-X windmill has 3 blades that spin with a diameter of 5 feet and weighs less than 25 pounds. The generator is capable of making over 600 watts. It begins spinning in 6 mph wind making a few watts of power. In 15 mph
    wind
    it can produce 200 watts of power. Peak observed power of 600 watts occurred at wind speeds over 25 mph. The manufacturer rates the generator at 1600 watts.</p>
  <p>The base unit includes the windmill, 100 feet of wire rope for hanging the windmill, 50 feet of power cable, and an electrical panel containing a digital meter that displays volts, amps and watts, terminals for hooking up your
    electrical device, and a voltage regulator. The voltage regulator is designed to brake or limit the speed of the blades in very high winds to avoid damage to the windmill.</p>
  <p>The RW-X windmill is designed to charge a 24 volt backup power system. The electric power being generated by the windmill can be converted to run or charge any device using an appropriate voltage converter.</p> -->
