    <P>
      The REVOLT wind turbine is super-easy to install, assemble, and operate.
    </P>
    <h4>Installation & Assembly:</h4>
    <p>Please use care and common sense when installing your REVOLT.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Select a location that is windy and where the windmill can be hung as high and as safely as possible.
      </li>
      <li>
        Make sure the unit will be located a reasonable distance away from objects, people, or structures so that the blades won't hit anything.
      </li>
      <li>Hang the windmill using the included wire rope or use a hook or bracket.</li>
      <li>The customer is responsible for attaching the wire rope to something that is strong enough to support the windmill.</li>
      <li>The wire rope has a breaking strength of 2000 pounds and must be securely attached at each end. When installed correctly, the force on the cable will be less than 50 pounds.</li>
      <li>Please consult an expert to determine your specific needs.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Operation:</h4>
    <p>
      Wait for the wind to blow! When it does, the windmill will begin producing power
      immediately. An
      on-board LED bulb located on the windmill will light up to let you know that you are
      producing
      power.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>USE CARE SO THAT ANY WIRES CONNECTED TO THE WINDMILL DO NOT GET TANGLED IN OR HIT BY
        THE
        BLADES. DO NOT ATTEMPT TO HANG YOUR PHONE OR ANY OTHER DEVICE FROM THE WINDMILL.
      </strong>
    </p>
    <h4>Maintenance</h4>
    <p>
      Windmills have moving parts and things with moving parts wear out over time. The magnets in
      the
      alternator can wear out from overheating, bearings can corrode over time due to excessive
      salt,
      moisture, or dust, plastic parts can become brittle and break from long-term UV exposure,
      and
      batteries have limited lifetimes. The good news is that all of the parts of the REVOLT can
      be
      replaced safely and inexpensively. All replacement parts will be available for order from our website soon. Contact us if you cannot find your replacement part(s) online.
