  <h5>Product Description for the RW-1</h5>
  <img src="/images/buy/hwt2.gif" alt="HWT spinning gif">
  <p>The RW-1 is capable of producing 200 watts continuously. When it first begins turning in 6-7 mph wind it makes 5-10
    watts (enough for 2 smartphones). In 15 mph wind it makes around 40 watts. It will make more than 200 watts in wind
    speeds above 20 mph. It will charge batteries rated to 24 volts easily with the proper battery charger. </p>
  <p>The diameter of the spinning blades is 52 inches. The windmill with blades weighs 16 pounds and it hangs on a hook
    or cable. Included with the windmill are 100 feet of braided steel cable for hanging the windmill and 50 feet of
    power cable.
    The power cable terminates in a stainless steel panel that houses the DC rectifier and digital display meter showing
    volts, amps, watts, and total Kilowatt hours.</p>

  <!-- <p>The RW-1 windmill has 3 blades that spin with a diameter of 4 feet and weighs about 16 pounds. The generator is capable of making over 200 watts.</p>
  <p>The base unit includes the windmill, 100 feet of wire rope for hanging the windmill, 50 feet of power cable, and an electrical panel containing a digital meter that displays volts, amps and watts, terminals for hooking up your
    electrical device, and a voltage regulator. The voltage regulator is designed to brake or limit the speed of the blades in very high winds to avoid damage to the windmill.</p>
  <p>The RW-1 windmill is designed to charge a 24 volt backup power system. The electric power being generated by the windmill can be converted to run or charge any device using an appropriate voltage converter.</p>
  <p>This windmill:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>begins spinning in a 6 mph wind making just a few watts of power.</li>
    <li>will make 5 watts in a 7 mph wind. That's enough power for 2 smart phones.</li>
    <li>will make 50 watts in a 15 mph wind. If it makes 50 watts for 12 hours it produces 1200 watts of total power. That is the same amount of power as standard car battery. That is enough power to charge an electric bike!</li>
    <li>will make 200 watts in over 20 mph winds.</li>
    <li>comes in a box.</li>
    <li>can be installed in one day using simple tools.</li>
    <li>does not require land.</li>
    <li>will begin making power as soon as it's hung in a windy area.</li>
  </ul> -->
