            <p>We are REVOLT wind. Our St. Louis, Missouri based company was founded on the principle that
              sustainable electric energy should be available to anyone anywhere for the lowest possible
              cost. It's that simple.</p>
            <video src="/videos/revoltcorp.mp4" poster="/videos/revoltcorp.jpg" width="100%" controls>
            </video>
            <p>Our mission is:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>to make low-cost wind energy available to everyone using our innovative and patented
                technology, and</li>
              <li>to use our technology to produce unique, new products that save lives, improve
                lifestyle, and reduce pollution.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The original hanging wind turbine was developed to charge an electric bike using sustainable
              energy and without a tower, permits, or any other expensive infrastructure. The windmill
              design was so successful that the technology was awarded US and international patents in
              2019. The original design has improved and evolved into the REVOLT wind turbine.</p>
            <p>Because the product is original, inexpensive, and powerful, we are determined to bring this
              windmill to market using the latest mass-production techniques. We believe that REVOLT wind
              turbines will be available for purchase and ready for worldwide distribution by the end of
              2019.</p>

            <p>STEPHEN COWAP founded <a href="https://bent-engineering.com" title="Bent Engineering" target="_blank">Bent Engineering LLC</a> in 2012 after inventing a novel structural
              support called the Glass Bent Beam. Since that time, he has invented and patented two new
              types of wind turbines, including the REVOLT wind turbine, that offer major advantages over
              existing wind turbine technology.</p>
            <p>Stephen has worked at Fortune 500 companies as a glass technologist for twenty years, was a
              member of ASTM C08, ran a testing laboratory, and was awarded a patent for a new glass batch
              additive for an industrial application at Owens Corning.</p>
            <p>In addition to holding a masterâ€™s degree in ceramic engineering from the University of
              Illinois (Tau Beta Pi), Stephen has a passion for model building, art, sculpture, and
              photography.</p>
            <p>Stephen's inventions include:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>The Glass Bent Beam is a structural support element made of glass laminated plates in
                the shape of a bent. It provides improved performance and appearance and withstands
                higher temperatures than existing steel or concrete beams.</li>
              <li>The Self-Orienting Hanging Wind Turbine hangs from an overhead attachment point. Because
                the design is scalable, it can be small and portable or large and powerful. It is easily
                lowered to the ground for maintenance.</li>
              <li>The Self-Orienting Vertical Axis Wind Turbine powers a rotating shaft that delivers
                mechanical power at ground level.</li>
              <li>The Aquaduck is a floating variation of the vertical axis wind turbine. It aerates
                stagnate or polluted water.</li>
              <li>The cathedral alternator is another variation of the vertical axis wind turbine that
                resides in the attic of buildings, generates electricity, and provides ventilation.</li>
              <li>The Radon Abatement System alleviates the buildup of dangerous gases.</li>
            </ul>
