                            <p>The hanging design was born to allow windmills to be deployed in areas where towers are not permitted.
                                It was originally named “The Gooseneck Alternator,” because the long and skinny counterbalance arm makes
                                it appear similar to a goose in flight. As the design evolved we learned that it could be built in a
                                range of sizes using the same blades and electric generator that are used on tower mounted windmills,
                                but at a fraction of the cost. And because the device is not anchored to the ground by the tower, you
                                can own it without owning the land beneath it, and take it with you when you need to. </p>
                            <p>The first 100 HWT’s (hanging wind turbines) are in production and should be available in January. We
                                are anxious find out how well this product will perform in your hands. </p>

                The REVOLT hangs from an overhead support such as a line strung between two points, a
                hook, bracket, or tree branch. It requires no tower, no permit, no real estate, no
                footers, and no guy wires making it inexpensive, fast and easy to set up.

                <!-- <img src="./images/buy/gallery2-4.gif"> -->
                <img src="./images/banner.jpg" alt="mini revolt at remote location">
                <p>Early adopters provide vital feedback that help us understand how this technology will perform in real-life
                    situations and how it will mesh with existing infrastructure. Current data indicate that hanging wind turbines
                    (HWTs) are making
                    electric power at a lower cost than other methods for producing electricity because they do not require you to
                    own the land on which it hangs, they do not require you to construct a tower, and they do not require permits
                    in most areas.
                    While the HWT is not currently classified as a permanent structure that requires permits, there may be
                    regulations in the future as greater numbers of HWTs are seen in operation.</p>
                <p>Wind speed increases with height above the ground, but many HWTs will be installed at low heights. Because
                    the HWT is a fraction of the cost of a tower-mounted machine, it will make electricity at a lower cost even in
                    lower wind speeds
                    near ground level. To optimize performance, channel or funnel the wind utilizing buildings, trees, hillsides,
                    and areas of thermal instability. It is also possible to hang a windmill higher than a tower can reach. The
                    knowledge gained from
                    your experiences will be used to design future systems for hanging and siting the machines.</p>
                <p>We believe that the number of uses for the hanging wind turbine is as great as the number of users. If the
                    HWT is successful in practice, it will usher in a new wave of portable electronic systems and devices. For
                    instance, a
                    rechargeable cell and WIFI communications chip installed onboard would allow HWTs to communicate with one
                    another. This communication system would allow for the construction of a truly wireless network that could not
                    be shut down by power
                    failures. Storms would not affect its operation and it would not depend upon grid power to operate. The HWT
                    provides an opportunity for you to invent on fertile ground, but it comes with the risk that there is little
                    operating data on the
                    product you are buying.</p><br />

                            REVOLT wind turbines performed equally well in rain, sleet, and snow. However, the
                            batteries
                            did
                            not! <u>Rechargeable batteries should not be used or stored in temperatures below 32⁰ F

                            size.
