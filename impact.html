						<h3>The Transformative Power of a Single Light Bulb</h3>
						<p>
							Alternative energy is the key to our collective future. If it's
							affordable, it can be accessible to everyone. Conventional energy
							sources and fossil fuels are polluting our planet. It just makes
							sense that we need to embrace inexpensive, greener practices.
						</p>
						<p>
							Because Revolt Wind Turbines are low-cost, they will help those in
							emerging markets connect to the Internet and join the World Wide
							Web, cook without using expensive or limited resources, and stay
							warm without producing dangerous fumes. Just acquiring the ability
							to read at night using a single light bulb is truly
							transformative.
						</p>
						<p>
							More than one billion people on this planet do not have access to
							the electric grid. Inexpensive, mass-produced windmills will
							literally change the quality of life for millions worldwide!

					<div class="feature-med">
						<div id="accordion">
							<h3>GLOBAL</h3>
							<div>
								<img
									src="/images/firewood.jpg"
									alt="woman carrying heavy firewood"
								/>
								<h4>Challenge</h4>
								<ul>
									<li>
										1.3 billion people burn kerosene for light, emitting 270,000
										tonnes of CO2.
									</li>
									<li>
										Collection of firewood and consumption of biomass for energy
										needs is causing deforestation rates to increase.
									</li>
									<li>
										A world in which nearly one-fifth of the population remains
										without access to any form of electricity represents not
										only developmental, but also economic growth issues on a
										global scale.
									</li>
								</ul>
								<h4>Opportunity</h4>
								<p>With Wind power:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>
										there is no burden on climate change and no increase of CO2
										emissions,
									</li>
									<li>
										rural families will no longer need to rely on dangerous
										kerosene lamps for light,
									</li>
									<li>deforestation rates will decrease, and</li>
									<li>
										only low levels of energy are needed to provide basic
										electricity and energy access.
									</li>
								</ul>
							</div>
							<h3>EDUCATION</h3>
							<div>
								<img
									src="/images/kerosene_lamp.jpg"
									alt="child reading by kerosene lamp"
								/>
								<h4>Challenge</h4>
								<p>
									Without electricity, children must study by a kerosene lamp
									which is expensive and dangerous. Many children spend several
									hours per day collecting firewood over distances of up to 10
									kilometers, or work to help their families afford the cost of
									traditional energy services.
								</p>
								<h4>Opportunity</h4>
								<p>
									With clean, inexpensive wind energy, families can afford to
									send their children to school instead of to work. Kids can
									study by LED at night. If they have a question, they can make
									a call or do research on a cellphone. With an LED, families
									can work late or help children study without burning their
									supply of kerosene.
								</p>
							</div>
							<h3>HEALTH</h3>
							<div>
								<img src="/images/smoke.jpg" alt="dangerous cloud of smoke" />
								<h4>Challenge</h4>
								<ul>
									<li>
										80% of rural households still use kerosene lamps for
										lighting.
									</li>
									<li>
										A kerosene lamp is as damaging to lungs as 40 cigarettes a
										day.
									</li>
									<li>
										2 million premature global deaths occur annually as a result
										of indoor air pollution.
									</li>
									<li>
										1 million deaths are from fires caused by kerosene lamps.
									</li>
									<li>
										50% of healthcare facilities in developing countries have no
										or unreliable access to electricity.
									</li>
								</ul>
								<h4>Opportunity</h4>
								<p>
									Wind energy can dramatically reduce carbon footprints by
									enabling the replacement of kerosene lamps with safe LED
									lighting.
								</p>
								<p>Replacing kerosene lamps with LED lighting will:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>
										improve respiratory health by reducing smoke in the home
										produced by kerosene lamps, and
									</li>
									<li>
										reduce burn injuries by 80% and reduce household fires by
										70%.
									</li>
								</ul>
								<p>
									With electricity and a charged cellphone, families can easily
									reach a doctor. Doctors can offer advice over the phone and
									respond to emergency situations. Mobile heath applications can
									verify medicines, provide directions, and help to ensure safe
									usage. Refrigeration and vaccine cooling will increase child
									vaccination by 47%.
								</p>
							</div>
							<h3>ECONOMICS</h3>
							<div>
								<img
									src="/images/business_night.jpg"
									alt="business operating at night"
								/>
								<h4>Challenge</h4>
								<p>
									80% of the rural, energy poor have incomes of less than US$3
									per day. Despite this, US$ 18.5 billion is spent on unhealthy
									and expensive sources of lighting and energy for cooking or
									productive uses, and US$18.5 billion is spent on charging
									mobile phones, flashlights and lighting. The US$37 billion
									spent on energy services represents more than 10% of the
									monthly household income.* In addition, more than 500 million
									people have access to mobile phones but not to electricity and
									up to 50% of costs of airtime are spent on expensive phone
									charging.
								</p>

								><br /><br />
								<h4>Opportunity</h4>
								<p>
									Green energy will dramatically reduce the cost for mobile
									charging and lighting (40% of household energy expenditure
									savings is expected through cheaper off-grid energy
									services*), run machinery and devices, create jobs through
									freed up time, and increase sales of energy-dependent devices
									such as radios, TVs, communication devices, sanitation
									devices, etc.

							<h3>PEOPLE</h3>
							<div>
								<img
									src="/images/clothes.jpg"
									alt="people wearing indiginous and colorful clothing"
								/>
								<h4>Challenge</h4>
								<ul>
									<li>
										About 1.3 billion people globally do not have access to
										reliable, affordable and clean electricity and lighting
										negatively affecting their quality of life.
									</li>
									<li>84% of those without electric live in rural areas.</li>
									<li>
										95% of those without electric live in Sub-Saharan Africa and
										developing Asia.
									</li>
								</ul>
								<cite>Source: World Economic Forum</cite><br /><br />
								<h4>Opportunity</h4>
								<p>
									Windmills can provide rural populations with energy for
									lighting, charging purposes, and other productive activities.
									Mini-grid based models have the potential to stimulate local
									economic growth and thus have a multiplier impact on the
									development perspectives and quality of life of rural
									households. At the same time, negative health impacts of
									indoor air pollution and environmental impacts are reduced by
									replacing kerosene lamps and diesel with renewable energy
									where applicable.
								</p>
							</div>
							<h3>REVOLT</h3>
							<div>
								<img
									src="/images/single_bulb.jpg"
									alt="man looking at a single light bulb"
								/>
								<h4>Challenge</h4>
								<p>
									To improve the health, well-being, opportunities available to
									rural communities, and ensure that all people have access to
									clean, inexpensive energy, we aim to:
								</p>
								<ul>
									<li>
										provide enough power to charge at least one cell phone,
									</li>
									<li>
										provide enough power to run an LED light for several hours
										each night, and
									</li>
									<li>provide income opportunities for rural entrepreneurs.</li>
								</ul>
								<h4>Opportunity</h4>
								<p>The REVOLT can improve quality of life by:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>
										Providing rural populations with affordable, sustainable,
										reliable, and healthy energy for lighting, charging and
										other productive activities
									</li>
									<li>
										Creating sustainable economic growth through improved access
										to phone charging services, mini-grid based services, or
										affiliate programs
									</li>
								</ul>
								<p>
									Local communities are not only expected to benefit from direct
									access to energy but also from the wider impacts of enabled
									economic activity, reduced health impacts, and reduced
									environmental damage.
